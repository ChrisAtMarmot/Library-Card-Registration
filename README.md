# Quickstart

## Install Node.js
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Install clasp
```
npm install @google/clasp -g
```

## Enable the Google Apps Script API
https://script.google.com/home/usersettings

## Edit Apps Script Code

In api.gs
```
var baseUrl = "https://YOUR-DOMAIN.org/iii/sierra-api/{v5,6}/";
```

In main.gs:
```
processForm handles the data send from the html form
newPatron = {} //this is the JSON patron object we post to the API
getExpirationdate() returns an expiration date of 30 days from today
```

index.html contains the form and is served by the doGet function when someone visits your web app

javascript.html gets included in index.html and has some functions associated with the form

This line calls the serverside processForm function with a success handler call back function:
```
google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(confirmation(data.email)).processForm(data);
```
